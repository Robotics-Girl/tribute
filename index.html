            Hello! Welcome to my Tribute page about Tomorrow, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, by Gabrielle Zevin! 
            Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow tells the sweeping tale of Sam Masur and Sadie Green, whose shared passion for video games transforms their lives. Reuniting during college, the two rekindle a childhood bond that evolves into a groundbreaking creative partnership. Together, they design Ichigo, a revolutionary game that thrusts them into the spotlight before they even graduate.As their fame grows, so do the emotional complexities of their relationship. Over the span of thirty years—from Boston to California and beyond—Sam and Sadie navigate the highs and lows of artistic success, personal loss, and the strain of ambition. At its heart, the novel is not a traditional romance, but a deep exploration of human connection, identity, disability, and the way creation—especially through games—can be a lifeline. It is a story about finding meaning in both failure and triumph, and the enduring need to be understood.
