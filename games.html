            <h2>Emily Blaster</h2>
            <p>EmilyBlaster is Sadie’s game created before she and Sam reconnected. It’s inspired by the poetry of Emily Dickinson and turns poetry into a different type of game. Players blast words in the right order to construct Dickinson’s poems. But the way that she describes it is different. She believes it is a different take on language, order, and how meaning is created and destroyed. Even though this started as a Sadie uses this game to experiment to experiment with the difference between literature and interactivity. Sadie is saying, through EmilyBlaster, that there’s no one way to make a game, and no one kind of person who should be allowed to make them. It should be everyone who should be able to make a game.</p>
